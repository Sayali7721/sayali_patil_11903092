	import sys
	randomList = ['a', 0, 10]

	for entry in randomList:
    	try:
        	print("The entry is", entry)
        	r = 1/int(entry)
    	    break
    	except:
        	print("Oops !", sys.exc_info()[0], "Occured")
        	print()
        	print("Next entry :")
	
	print("The reciprocal of", entry,"Is",r)

OUTPUT :
	The entry is a
	Oops ! <class 'ValueError'> Occured

	Next entry :
	The entry is 0
	Oops ! <class 'ZeroDivisionError'> Occured
	
	Next entry :
	The entry is 10
	The reciprocal of 10 Is 0.1
